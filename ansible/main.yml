 Based on your instructions, here's an example of a basic Ansible playbook that follows your rules for generating functional playbooks:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    my_var: "example"

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: latest

    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Copy nginx configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/nginx.conf
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    - name: Enable and start Apache service
      systemd:
        name: apache2
        enabled: yes
        state: started
```
